Like other search engines, we make money through ads, but we use 100% of our profits for the planet. The Ecosia community has already planted 150 million trees in over 35 countries.\n\nPlant trees with your searches and be climate active every day â€” Ecosia users are tackling climate change, protecting wildlife, and collaborating with local communities around the world, planting the right trees in the right places.\n\nProtect your privacy â€” We donâ€™t create a profile of you, never sell your data to advertisers, and your searches are always SSL-encrypted. We want trees, not your data.\n\nBecome climate positive â€” Not only do the trees we plant absorb CO2, we also have our own solar plants. They don't just produce enough renewable energy to power all your searches, but twice as much! This means more renewables (and fewer fossil fuels) in the electricity grid.\n\nRadical transparency â€” Our monthly financial reports disclose all of our projects so you can see exactly what we spend money on. Weâ€™re a not-for-profit tech company that dedicates 100% of its profits to climate action.\n\nGet Ecosia today and be climate active every day.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWebsite: https://ecosia.org\nOur blog: https://blog.ecosia.org/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ecosia\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ecosia\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ecosia\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/EcosiaORG\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@ecosia","weeklyDownloads":1074,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Ecosia Dev Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13412650/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/270/270325.png?modified=1654770426","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/270/270325.jpg?modified=1654770426","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/270/270326.png?modified=1654770426","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/270/270326.jpg?modified=1654770426","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/270/270327.png?modified=1654770426","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/270/270327.jpg?modified=1654770426","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/270/270328.png?modified=1654770426","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/270/270328.jpg?modified=1654770426","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/270/270329.png?modified=1654770426","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/270/270329.jpg?modified=1654770426","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.8065,"reviewCount":183,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ecosia-the-green-search/reviews/","updateDate":1654769788000}]}
